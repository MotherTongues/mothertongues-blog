# Mother Tongues Blog

Welcome to the Mother Tongues Blog repository.

## Guide

To contribute to the site, please have a read through the purpose of the Git branches:

- master: The `master` branch is auto generated from the `release` branch. Do **not** edit this directly, as edits will be overwritten.
- release: Push releases here, this branch will build and push to `master`.
- dev.author: Create and continue to work on new posts here. You can spin off extra branches like `dev.author-aidan` for example, but you must merge them into `dev.author` before merging to `release` and pushing a new release.
- dev.site: Make changes to the website here. Changes can be merged with `release` branch.
