# TL;DR

This tutorial will help you adapt the popular [Wordle game](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) to another language!

# What you need to know to understand this post

- In order to do this, you'll have to know a little bit about web development, or at least not be intimidated to get your hands dirty in some code! If that already sounds intimidating, hopefully you continue to read on a bit - it might be scary at first but it gets easier! Remember there are a lot of resources online to help you and you can always reach out to me if you have questions.
- Specifically, you'll need a [GitHub Account](https://github.com/), a text editor for code (I like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)), and, ideally, a computer with [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed and ready for devlopment.

# What are the motivations behind this project/technology/tip?

Everybody I know has been loving the Wordle game in English, and there are many other Wordlers who have made clones of the original Wordle. I 'forked' (ie copied) Hannah Park's (@hannahcode) [open source clone](https://github.com/hannahcode/wordle) and adapted it to allow for different languages.

# How to make your Wordle

## Step 1: Get the code

The first step is to copy my version of the @hannahcode's clone to your computer: 

`git clone https://github.com/roedoejet/wordle.git`

Run the above command in your command line. 

Then, you will need to install all the dependencies:

`cd wordle && npm install`

Tada! You can now run my copy on your machine:

`npm serve`

## Step 2: Change the orthography (writing system)

You can change the `ORTHOGRAPHY` variable in `src/constants/orthography.ts` to use your language's alphabet. This must be a list of strings, and the letters can be more than one character long. Don't change the name of the variable, or anything else. For example if your language has the five letters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'aa', and 'aaa':

```typescript
export const ORTHOGRAPHY = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'aa', 'aaa'] as const;
```

## Step 3: Change the words

You can change the valid guesses and the wordlist used by wordle in the `src/constants/validGuesses.ts` and `src/constants/wordlist.ts` files. Just replace the list that is there with new lists. Note: all the words have to be of the same length! The default for Wordle is 5 letters long (not characters!), but you can change this in the configuration in Step 4.

## Step 4: Configure the app

You can change other aspects related to the app in `src/constants/config.ts`. Here is the default with a description for each value:

```typescript
export const CONFIG = {
    tries: 6, // This changes how many tries you get to finish the wordle
    language: "YourLanguageHere", // This changes the display name for your language
    wordLength: 5, // This sets how long each word is based on how many characters (as defined in orthography.ts) are in each word
    googleAnalytics: "", // You can use this if you use Google Analytics
    author: "YourNameHere", // Put your name here so people know who made this Wordle!
    authorWebsite: "YourLinkHere", // Put a link to your website or social media here
    wordListSource: "YourDictionarySource", // Describe the source material for your words here
    wordListSourceLink: "YourDictionaryLink" // Put a link to the source material for your words here
}
```

Note, you don't need to use googleAnalytics, but you should put something for all the other parameters!

## Step 5: Publish

Wait - are you *sure* you have permission to publish this? Are you a member of the language community? Did you ask permission and follow the proper protocols? Just because you *can* build something cool doesn't necessarily mean you *should*.

After that little proviso, you can publish to your GitHub by changing the `homepage` value in the `package.json` as seen below. Change the 'roedoejet' (my GitHub username), to your GitHub username, and leave everything else the same.

Then, run `npm run-script deploy` and then visit your Wordle at that address: https://yourusername.github.io/wordle

You can change the words or make other changes and then deploy again. Congratulations - you did it!

## Advanced

I'll put some stuff here for advanced users.

### Custom Domain

If you want to use a custom domain, first create a CNAME record, then change the `deploy` script to create a CNAME file before deploying: 

```
{...
    "scripts": {
        "start": "react-scripts start",
        "predeploy": "npm run build",
        "deploy": "echo 'yourdomain.org' > ./build/CNAME && gh-pages -d build",
        "build": "react-scripts build",
        "test": "react-scripts test",
        "eject": "react-scripts eject"
    }
}
```

This will set the domain properly for GitHub Pages.
