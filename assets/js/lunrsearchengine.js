What you need to know to understand this post: You will need to know how to:  How to edit your website’s CSS How to add a &lt;link&gt; element to your HTML’s &lt;head&gt;If you’ve ever added a custom font from Google Fonts to yourwebsite, you know enough to follow this post! It’s also helpful to know the difference between serif and sans-seriffonts. Let’s get started!: Have you ever wanted to display Cree syllabics on your website, butwhen you tried, all you got were these blank boxes, colloquially calledtofu?  □□□ □□□□□□! □□□□□□□□□□ □□□□□ «□ □□□□□□□□□»□ Tofu no longer! Let’s discuss the various syllabics fonts that exist outthere, where they are commonly found, and let’s create a font stack:a list of fonts that your web browser tries in order such that it findsa font that displays syllabics correctly.  Note: I am most familiar with Western Cree Syllabics (Y-dialect, Th-dialect, N-dialect).  However most of these fonts might work for other languages.  Note that some fonts in this post do not contain all syllabics characters for all languages that use syllabics, and there's even some incorrect characters in one font! 😱 So even though this is the stack I guarantee to work for Western Cree, for other languages, your mileage may vary. Common syllabics fonts: I will discuss the following fonts:  Aboriginal Sans and Aboriginal Serif Euphemia Gadugi Noto Sans Canadian AboriginalThere are many more syllabics fonts out there, but in this post, I wantto focus on just enough for you to make syllabics work on websites. I made an interactive demonstration of these fonts that you can playwith. Go ahead and type any text in Western Cree into the box and itwill be converted to syllabics and displayed in the appropriate font, ifit’s available on your system:  See the Pen  Syllabics font playground by Eddie Antonio Santos (@eddieantonio) on CodePen. But where do these fonts come from? Where should you expect these fonts to beavailable? Aboriginal Sans and Aboriginal Serif: As the names suggest, they have both serif and sans-serif variants forwriting in Latin script (e. g. , English, French, etc. ). Who created these fonts?: These fonts were created by the Language Geek himself, Chris Harvey. Where are these fonts pre-installed?: As far as I know, no system has Aboriginal Sans or Aboriginal Serifpre-installed, so you have to download them yourself from hiswebsite. Sometimes, they are bundled with certainKeyman keyboard layouts. If you’ve tried getting syllabics to work on your computer, chances are,you’ve downloaded either of these fonts! Languagegeek. com has many other fonts thatdisplay syllabics. Gadugi: This is a modern font that displays both syllabics and Cherokee. “Gadugi” is a Cherokee word that means “cooperativelabour”. Who created this font?: I believe Microsoft commissioned this font. Where is this font pre-installed?: Gadugi has been included in all versions of Windows since Windows8. It’s also available as a “Cloudfont” on Microsoft Office products. Euphemia: Euphemia or Euphemia UCAS1 is a sleek font for syllabics. It alsoincludes glyphs for Latin (e. g. , English/French) characters. Who created this font?: Tiro Typeworks created Euphemia. Ross Mills from Tiro has alsocreated the Pigiarniq for Inuktitut, but I will not cover that fontin this blog post. Where is this font pre-installed?: Euphemia is distributed on Windows Vista and newer. It is currently distributed as Euphemia UCAS on Apple systems(macOS/iOS). Issues: Unfortunately, for East Cree, this font will NOT work, as it has theincorrect orientation for the ᔓ (sho) and ᔕ (sha) syllabics 😱 So I would recommend omitting it from the font stack for EasternCree. So if you can’t use Euphemia, which font should you use instead? Noto Sans Canadian Aboriginal: Noto is Google’s project to eliminate tofu (□) for all languages of theworld, hence noto (“no more tofu”). As far as I’m aware, Google does not have a “Noto Serif CanadianAboriginal”. Who created this font?: As mentioned, Google created Noto Sans! Where is this font pre-installed?: Noto Sans Canadian Aboriginal can be found on Google products, such asAndroid phones, Android tablets, and Chromebooks. Importantly, Google allows website authors to embed Noto on yourwebsite, just as you can embed other fonts via their Google Fontsservice. Most modern web browsers will automatically download Noto Sans ifyou included it in your font stack and no appropriate font is found. How to get the right fonts to appear on your webpage: Now that we know about what fonts are out there, lets constructa font-family declaration that will support syllabics on as manydevices as possible. Recall that the font-family declaration is a list of fonts that theweb browser will try in order. The first font in the list that isinstalled will be used. Let’s start with the fallbacks first. Let’s say our users’ devicedoes not have a font that supports syllabics installed on theircomputer. Since Google allows Noto Sans Canadian Aboriginal to beautomatically downloaded on your website when needed, let’s start withthis font-family declaration: body { font-family: 'Noto Sans Canadian Aboriginal', sans-serif;}To get your browser to download the appropriate fonts, add this to yourwebsite’s &lt;head&gt;: &lt;link rel= stylesheet  href= //fonts. googleapis. com/earlyaccess/notosanscanadianaboriginal. css &gt;Add support for Aboriginal Sans: Perhaps your reader has installed Aboriginal Sans to their computer. Update your font-family declaration as follows: body { font-family: 'Aboriginal Sans', 'Noto Sans Canadian Aboriginal', sans-serif;}This way, the web browser will try using Aboriginal Sans if it’sinstalled, and then attempt to download Noto Sans. Add support for Mac/iPhone/iPad users: (omit this step for East Cree!) Now let’s support users of Apple devices. Prepend Euphemia UCAS tothe font-family declaration: body { font-family: 'Euphemia UCAS', 'Aboriginal Sans', 'Noto Sans Canadian Aboriginal', sans-serif;}Add support for Windows Users: Recall that earlier versions of Windows include Euphemia; laterversions support Gadugi. Prepend the following rules to try usingGadugi first. body { font-family: Gadugi, Euphemia, 'Euphemia UCAS', 'Aboriginal Sans', 'Noto Sans Canadian Aboriginal', sans-serif;}Finally, specify your Latin fonts: If you’re displaying Latin text (e. g. , English, French, Cree SRO, etc. ),then this font goes first. Recall that many of the syllabics fontscontain glyphs for Latin characters, so we will have to listour preferred Latin font first. For this example, say I want to use Open Sans (which you canembed from Google Fonts). Prepend Open Sans to the front ofthe list: body { font-family: 'Open Sans', Gadugi, Euphemia, 'Euphemia UCAS', 'Aboriginal Sans', 'Noto Sans Canadian Aboriginal', sans-serif;}You’re done! You’re ready to display syllabics on the web! Finished!: With these declarations, you should be able to display syllabics on yourwebsite, and be reasonably confident that everybody can read it. Here’s a complete example that uses our syllabics font stack inaddition to a few fonts from Google Fonts to round things out:  See the Pen  Syllabics font stack complete example by Eddie Antonio Santos (@eddieantonio) on CodePen.       UCAS, or “Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics”, the name of the Unicode block that this font covers.  &#8617;    "

    "body": "2020/08/13 - TL;DRHave you ever wanted to NOT spend hours tediously checking that k + ‘ is written as k̓ and not k’?If you said YES!, Convertextract is the app for you. With minimal technical knowledge, you can now systemically make your ELAN annotations consistent. What you need to know to understand this postI assume that you know some background about the g2p library. For the purposes of using these tools, a library is a collection of code and documentation, but if you would like to dig deeper you can check out this Wikipedia article The g2p library uses existing and custom mappings (i. e. arbitrary input-&gt;output conversions). For example, you might want k’ (input) to be converted to k̓ (output). The Mapping is the roadmap for converting. These conversions are arbitrary, so depending on your use case you may need to create new mappings. Most of the existing mappings convert Graphemes (a character in the writing system of a language) to Phonemes (their equivalent sound in the language), hence the name ‘g2p’. To see existing mappings click hereTo keep this post simple, I will not explain how to add new g2p mappings. The documentation for adding mappings is here Who is involved with this project?   Kwak̓wala Corpus Collection group   Sara Child saratlilinukw@gmail. com Daisy Rosenblum daisy. rosenblum@ubc. ca Caroline Running Wolf caroline. oldcoyote@gmail. com     App developer: Aidan Pine     Support for adding mappings/parsers: Fineen Davis  What is needed to replicate the content in the post? g2p Mapping of the desired conversions Language text to be converted Convertextract app (read the post for installation!)What are the motivations behind this technology?As a Student Intern on the NRC’s Indigenous Language Technology (ILT) project, I was approached by the Kwak̓wala Corpus Collection group to help create a systemic way to streamline the quality control process for their ELAN annotation data. Having many different people with many different orthographic conventions (i. e. different ways of writing the same thing) all working on annotating Kwak̓wala language data had resulted in inconsistencies. For example, there was four ways that people were writing t̓s:  t’s, t̕s, ts̓, ts’So, I added mappings in the g2p library that took the alternative forms and streamlined them therefore producing only one form in the output. Then I added support for ELAN files in the Convertextract library, so that the process became automated. Aidan Pine then turned Convertextract into an app! How to use the new Convertextract app for ‘quality control’ of ELAN annotationsConvertextract, created by Aidan Pine, is a python library which extracts text data and finds/replaces specific text based on arbitrary correspondences. Until now, only basic CLI (Command Line Interface) was supported. Using Convertextract in the CLI allowed the user to convert a file based on pre-existing Mappings in the g2p library or based on a custom Mapping (not described here). However, the downside is that some programming knowledge is needed to use the CLI. The latest update now includes a GUI (Graphical User Interface) in the form of an app (for Mac computers only). The app makes Convertextract more accessible for non-programmers. 1. G2P mapping: Convertextract will carry out the streamlining for you, but it has to know what to convert. The g2p Mapping is this roadmap. See the section What you need to know to understand this post for more information on how to see if your language is supported. 2. Language data: You language data must be in one of the supported file formats. The most recent addition is . eaf files, which allows ELAN annotations to be used!For a full list of supported file types click here. 3. Convertextract application: Installation: IMPORTANT The app works on Mac only!!! To download the app: https://github. com/roedoejet/convertextract/releases In your downloads folder, find the . zip file and double click on it to unzip.  Downloads&gt;convertextractRight-click on the application in the dist folder and select Open.  Downloads&gt;convertextract&gt;dist&gt;ConvertextractNote: If you try to double click to open the app, you will get a security message. Right-clicking to open will allow you to override the security message. Using the app: This is what the app looks like when you open it.  All you have to do is add your language data, choose the encoding (usually ‘utf-8’ should suffice), and pick your g2p mapping!The output will be exported as a copy of the input file + _converted. ext in the filename. Example caseWhen typing, there is more than one way to write k̓ in the Kwak̓wala language. Convertextract takes all of these possibilities and generates one output for the sake of consistency. I used the following inputs for Convertextract:  Encoding: utf-8 Input_language: kwk-umista  Output_language: kwk-umista-conPerforming ‘quality control’           Input language   Output language         Language code   kwk-umista   kwk-umista-con       Sample text   kwak’wala   kwak̓wala           kwak]wala   kwak̓wala   If you need help setting up the app or have any questions at all, please feel free to comment below or send me an email!

    "title": "Why I made yet another Cree syllabics converter",
    "body": "2020/08/07 - The Western Cree languages—Plains Cree, Woods Cree, and Swampy Cree—are written using two systems: one with letters borrowed from theEnglish alphabet, in a system known as the standard Roman orthography (SRO), and ᓀᐦᐃᔭᐏ ᒐᐦᑭᐯᐦᐃᑲᓇ (Cree syllabics). SRO is relatively easy to type on a modern computer, but syllabics are more difficult, because of the lack of a well-established syllabics input layout. It’s easier to just use a converter which, given Cree text in SRO, produces Cree text in syllabics. In this post, I describe my criticisms of the converters that existed prior to July 2018, and introduce syllabics. app—a syllabics converter that I developed in reaction to the former converters. What you need to know to understand this post: For the latter part of this blog post, where I discuss using theconverter in your own project, I assume you know how to use:  npm for installing JavaScript packages; or pip for installing Python packagesIf you don’t care about embedding my converter in your coding project,then there’s no prior technical knowledge needed! What are the freely available transliterators?: A quick Google search will net you at least the following SRO to syllabics transliterators.  The Maskwacîs Plains Cree Syllabic Converter1 The Algonquian Linguistic Atlas Cree Syllabics Converter Syllabics. net’s Plains Cree Syllabics ConverterHowever, none of these transliterators are perfect. The issues: Word final “hk”: In syllabics, a word that ends with an “hk”—or «ᐠ» in syllabics—aresupposed end with «ᕽ» instead. However, this replacement can never occur in the middle of a word. For example, the word “ê-wêpâpîhkêwêpinamâhk” (we (and not you) are setting it swinging), contains both a final “hk” and a “hk” cluster in the middle of the word. Its syllabic transcription is ᐁᐍᐹᐲᐦᑫᐍᐱᐊᒫᕽ. The Algonquian Linguistic Atlas’s converter and syllabics. net’s converter both handle the conversion of “hk” to «ᐠ», without erroneously converting the sequence in the middle of a word. Notably, the community of Maskwacîs does not follow this convention. Therefore, the Maskwacîs Converter produces ᐁ ᐁᐧᐸᐱᐦᑫᐁᐧᐱᓇᒪᐦᐠ, unlike what is expected in other Cree communities. Transliterating non-Cree words: Some transliterators attempt to convert every Latin character, even if it doesn’t make sense. Take the case of “Maskêkosihk Trail”—a road that goes from Edmonton to Enoch Cree Nation. The City of Edmonton unveiled the street sign, and, in the process, they unveiled an embarrassment:     “Maskêkosihk trail” erroneously converted as «ᒪᐢᑫᑯᓯᐦᐠ ᐟrᐊᐃl»   Image source: CBC   Not only does the syllabics transliteration of the sign contain the “hk”cluster as mentioned above,2 but it half-transliterates the English word “trail” into syllabics. The result is that “trail” is rendered as «ᐟrᐊᐃl», which contains Latin characters in the transliteration! In my opinion, an SRO to syllabics transliterator should refuse to transliterate words that do not have the structure of a Cree word. However, all three of the mentioned transliterators do attempt to transliterate “trail” with differing results:3       Maskwacîs Cree Dictionary   ᐟrᐊᐃl       Algonquian Linguistic Atlas   ᐟᕒᐊᐃᐪ       Syllabics. net   ᐟᕒᐊᐃᓬ   Long vowels: Long vowels (êîôâ) are distinct from short vowels (ioa) in Cree. Long vowels are written with a dot above in syllabics. The exception is for “ê” because it is always long; as a result, some writers also drop the diacritic when writing “e” in SRO as well. It’s important to differentiate between long and short vowels, because it makes distinctions between words. For example, nipiy/ᓂᐱᕀ means “water” while nîpiy/ᓃᐱᕀ means “leaf”. However, there is such a thing as “plain” script, where the vowel dots are omitted, and pointed script where the vowels have all dots. Another complication is that the “standard” Roman orthography in practice has multiple conventions for writing long vowels: using a macron (◌̄) and using a circumflex (◌̂). 4 How do the various converters handle long vowel diacritics? The Maskwacîs converter does not produce dots for long vowels at all, however it accepts both macrons and circumflexes as input. The Algonquian Lingustic Atlas’s converter not only produces dots, but supports input in either macrons or circumflexes. The syllabics. net converter does worst of all, handling only macrons for long vowels. It simply spits out characters written with circumflexes. Additionally, it does not handle “ê” without an diacritics, which all other converters do. Other odds and ends: Other issues for syllabics converters include how they deal with dashes, how they deal with combining diacritics, rather than pre-composed characters, and whether they produce the correct Unicode characters for the syllabics rather than very convincing look-alikes. There’s also the sandhi orthographic rule, but honestly, I’m not sure I fully comprehend how to apply this rule myself. Summary: Here’s a breakdown of the previous issues, and whether each transliterator can handle it correctly.           Word-final “hk”   Non-Cree words   Long vowels         Maskwacîs Cree Dictionary   *   ❌   ❌       Algonquian Linguistic Atlas   ✅   ❌   ✅       Syllabics. net   ✅   ❌   ❌   Where’s the source code?: The most pressing issue to me personally is that I cannot find source code for any of these converters! This means that if other people want to incorporate a converter into their own app without an active internet connection, they can’t. They have to either reverse-engineer the converters online, or write their own code to do the conversion. cree-sro-syllabics: an open-source Python and JavaScript library for syllabics conversion: My solution was to create a code library that is free and open source. It is available both for Python and JavaScript, and you can try it out right now! It handles all the issues previously mentioned. Try it with the following test cases:  Maskekosihk trail êwêpâpîhkêwêpinamahk ēwēpâpīhkēwēpinamahk ewepapihkewepinamahkThe source code for cree-sro-syllabics can be found on their respective GitHub repositories:  cree-sro-syllabics for Python cree-sro-syllabics for JavaScriptBut it can also be seamlessly incorporated into a Python project that uses pip by installing it with: pip install cree-sro-syllabicsOr, you can use npm to install cree-sro-syllabics in your JavaScript project: npm install cree-sro-syllabics --saveOr you can copy-paste the . js file to your project. Use cases: Most folks will just use syllabics. app to convert a few words orsentences of Cree. However, software developers can embed the converter in clever ways in their application. For example, I’ve used the converter in itwêwina — the Plains Cree dictionary. Although the underlying dictionary content is written entirely in SRO, we can present all Cree text in syllabics.

    "body": "2020/08/07 - This blog post describes the background context for a software tool called g2p which is shorthand for ‘Grapheme-to-Phoneme’, but if you don’t know those terms, don’t worry, this post will explain it. Essentially, g2p is a tool for systematically converting between two types of text. Common use cases include converting between a writing system and the phonetic alphabet, between two writing systems for the same language, or between a legacy ‘font-hacked’ writing system and its current Unicode-supported version. What you need to know to understand this post To understand the advanced section, you will need to know some PythonWho is involved with this project? Maintainer (i. e. the person to bug with questions): Aidan Pine Lots of other contributorsWhat are the motivations behind G2P?There are many reasons why you might want to systematically convert between different characters1. Here are a few possible use cases: Use Case #1: Getting the pronunciation from a word’s spelling: Sometimes you want to convert between a language’s writing system (also known as orthography) and its pronunciation. “Letters” in a writing system are usually referred to as “graphemes” and their corresponding meaningful sounds are referred to as “phonemes”; hence “g2p” or “grapheme-to-phoneme”. It gets a little more complicated than that though, because sometimes a grapheme is made of more than one character, as in “th” which can be pronounced unvoiced. ) as in ‘thin’ or voiced as in ‘that’. The International Phonetic Alphabet is not so ambiguous, and writes the ‘th’ in ‘thin’ as θ and the ‘th’ in ‘that’ as ð. Knowing how to convert between the written and spoken form of a language is useful in a variety of computational tasks, but I will describe the usefulness specifically with a project called “ReadAlongs” below. Use Case #2: A language with multiple writing systems: Some languages have two (or more!) different writing systems. Take Cree for example, where you can either write a word in Standard Roman Orthography like “ê-wêpâpîhkêwêpinamâhk” or in Syllabics like ᐁᐍᐹᐲᐦᑫᐍᐱᐊᒫᕽ. My colleague Eddie has a great blog post about a tool he created to convert between the two here. Use Case #3: Converting from legacy writing systems: Some languages historically used ‘font hacks’ to render the characters in their writing system before they were supported standardly on computers. There’s a longer discussion to be had here, but the coles’ notes version is that when computers were gaining popularity, they weren’t typically able to render (ie display) characters outside of the 128 characters supported by the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). To get around this, language communities would come up with their own custom fonts (often referred to as ‘font hacks’ or ‘font encodings’) where they would render characters like ‘©’ which existed in ASCII as ‘ǧ’ instead (example taken from the Heiltsuk Doulos font). For more information on this topic, please check out ‘Seeing the Heiltsuk Orthography from Font Encoding through to Unicode’ or ‘Applications and innovations in typeface design for North American Indigenous languages’. How to get from ‘a’ to ‘b’ (or ‘a’ to ‘æ’) with g2pg2p is a Python library2 that helps you convert between different characters based on user-defined rules. The inspiration for how to write these rules was mostly taken from the notion of phonological rewrite rules, which is a common way of describing ‘multi-level’ phonological changes in linguistics. What is meant by that is the idea that a word, like ‘cats’ or ‘dogs’ can have multiple ‘levels’ of representation. For example, you might think of the way that those words are written in English orthography (writing system) as one level. Then, you might think of a general pronunciation for those words, written in the phonetic alphabet, as another level. You could also separate that level into more than one level by having a level each for narrow and broad transcriptions.       Level Name   Word #1   Word #2   Word # 3         Level 1 (orthography)   cat   dog   back       Level 2 (broad IPA)   kæt   dɑɡ   bæk       Level 3 (narrow IPA)   kʰæt   dɑɡ   bæk   Now, just by looking at these three levels, you can probably see some fairly systematic rules here that you could imagine would get you from one level to the next, even if you don’t know the phonetic alphabet by-heart and even if you don’t really know about the English phonology (sound patterns and systems). First of all, it looks like all of the ‘a’ characters in level one turn to ‘æ’, so we might want a rule to express that all instances of ‘a’ turn to /æ/. And, for another example, it looks like between levels 2 and 3, /k/ turns into either [k] or [kʰ] depending on whether it occurs before or after /æ/3. So, with these hypotheses about the rules to transform from one level to another, how do we start translating this into rules for g2p? Basic Rule writing: g2p lets you describe these patterns using an ordered list of rules. Each rule must be defined to have an sequence of one or more input characters and a sequence of zero or more output characters. We can define these rules in g2p either using a tabular, spreadsheet format (csv) or using a format called JavaScript Object Notation or JSON. To actually write these rules along with this blog post, I recommend getting some sort of text editor, like Visual Studio Code. You could also write the spreadsheet-type rules in your favourite spreadsheet editor.       in   out         a   æ   or using JSON: [  {     in :  a ,     out :  æ   }]Both of the above rules capture our first, rule that turns an orthographic ‘a’ into a broad IPA /æ/. You can choose to write your rules in either format, although JSON will offer you slightly more flexibility when writing advanced rules. If we want to write rules that depend on a particular context, we need a couple more columns (csv) or keys (JSON) than just in and out. This is where we use context_before and context_after. So, our second rule from above was to turn /k/ to [kʰ] when the character after /k/ is /æ/. Here, we could write the rules like this:       in   out   context_before   context_after         k   kʰ       æ   or like this using JSON: [  {     in :  k ,     out :  kʰ ,     context_after :  æ   }]Ok, so how do I actually get started here?: So, you’ve understood the basics of writing rules either described above and you want to actually use them to convert something! This section describes exactly how to do that. The easiest way to write rules quickly is using the G2P Studio web application4. Once landing on the G2P Studio page, you can scroll down to the Custom Rules section and start directly editing the spreadsheet available there. Below is a list of all the rules to capture the transformations between level 1 and level 2 above. There are some rules that we discussed in that section, and some others that might look unfamiliar. For a full description of some of these rules, have a look at the advanced rule-writing section.  Then, you can write some text in the left text-area at the top of the G2P Studio, and g2p will apply your rules and produce the output in the right text area as seen below: You can then click on ‘Export’ under the Custom Rules section to export your rules to a CSV file if you want to save them for later. Mapping configuration: When you combine multiple rules in g2p for a particular purpose, this is called a mapping. In addition to each file containing your rules, you need a configuration file that tells g2p how to process your rules. We write mapping configurations in files titled config. yaml. You will need some sort of text editor, like VS Code in order to edit your configuration file. Here is a basic configuration for your mapping: mappings: - language_name: English # this is a shared value for all the mappings in this configuration  display_name: English to IPA # this is a 'display name'. It is a user-friendly name for your mapping.   in_lang: eng # This is the code for your language input. By convention in g2p this should contain your language's ISO 639-3 code  out_lang: eng-ipa # This is the code for the output of your mapping. By convention in g2p we suffix -ipa to the in_lang for mappings between an orthography and IPA  type: mapping   authors: # This is a way to keep track of who has contributed to the mapping   - Aidan Pine  mapping: eng_to_ipa. json # This is the path to your mapping file. It should be in the same folder as your config. yaml fileIf you are familiar with yaml, you will see that you can have more than one mapping under the mappings key. So to add another mapping to this file, it would look like this: mappings: - language_name: English   display_name: English to IPA   in_lang: eng   out_lang: eng-ipa   type: mapping   authors:   - Aidan Pine  mapping: eng_to_ipa. json  - language_name: English  display_name: English IPA to Arpabet  in_lang: eng-ipa   out_lang: eng-arpabet  type: mapping   authors:    - Aidan Pine  mapping: eng_ipa_to_arpabet. json Special settings: You can add extra settings to your configuration file to change the way that g2p interprets your mappings. Below is a list of possible settings and their use. All of the settings keys below must be declared for each individual mapping in your config. yaml and must be declared on the same level as all of the other keys (language_name, in_lang, out_lang etc). These settings can also be set in the G2P Studio instead of in a config. yml file. as_is (default: True)As described in the earlier part of this post, your rules apply in the order you write them. And as described in the advanced section on rule ordering, sometimes this can make your mapping produce unexpected results! If you set your mapping to as_is: false, g2p will sort all of your rules based on the length of the input to the rule, so that rules with longer inputs apply before rules with shorter inputs. This prevents some common ‘bleeding’ rule-ordering relationships described in the rule ordering section. So, if you declared your rules as: [  {     in :  a ,     out :  b   },    {     in :  ab ,     out :  c   }]Then, with as_is set to True (the default), you would get ‘bb’ as the output for the input ‘ab’. Whereas with as_is set to False, you would get ‘c’ as the output for the input ‘ab’. mappings: - language_name: English   display_name: English to IPA   in_lang: eng   out_lang: eng-ipa   type: mapping  authors:   - Aidan Pine  mapping: eng_to_ipa. json   as_is: false  # &lt;------- Add thiscase_sensitive (default: True)The default is to treat your rules as case sensitive, but setting this to False, will make your rules case insensitive. mappings: - language_name: English   display_name: English to IPA   in_lang: eng   out_lang: eng-ipa   type: mapping  authors:   - Aidan Pine  mapping: eng_to_ipa. json   case_sensitive: false  # &lt;------- Add thisescape_special (default: False)As described in the section on regular expressions, you can define rules using ‘special’ characters. By default, these characters are interpreted as ‘special’, but if you want all special characters in your mapping to be interpreted as their actual characters, you can set escape_special to true. mappings: - language_name: English   display_name: English to IPA   in_lang: eng   out_lang: eng-ipa   type: mapping  authors:   - Aidan Pine  mapping: eng_to_ipa. json   escape_special: true  # &lt;------- Add thisnorm_form (default: “NFD”)If you’ve never heard of Unicode normalization don’t worry, you’re not alone! But, for writing rules and mappings using g2p, there can be some surprising ‘gotcha’ moments if you don’t choose the right normalization strategy. The basic gist of the problem is that there can be multiple ways to write the same character in Unicode, depending on whether you use ‘combining characters’ to type or not. For example, on some keyboards, you might type ‘é’ by writing an e first and then another keystroke to type the acute accent that sits above it. The Unicode representation for this would likely be \u0065 (e) followed by \u0301 (a combining acute accent), however there is an entirely separate Unicode code point that has these two characters pre-composed (\u00e9). Many fonts will render these two different representations identically and it can be really difficult and confounding as a user if both appear in the same text. Often times find/replace won’t work and frustrating things like that. Luckily, there is a standard for normalizing these differences so that all instances of sequences like \u0065\u0301 would be (NF)Composed into \u00e9, or the opposite direction where all instances of \u00e9 would be (NF)Decomposed into \u0065\u0301. For a more in-depth conversation on this, check out this blog article. mappings: - language_name: English   display_name: English to IPA   in_lang: eng   out_lang: eng-ipa   type: mapping  authors:   - Aidan Pine  mapping: eng_to_ipa. json   norm_form:  NFC   # &lt;------- Add your Unicode normalization strategy hereout_delimiter (default: ‘’)Some mappings require that a delimiting character (or characters) be inserted in between when a rule applies. So, using the first example, maybe you want kæt to go to kʰ|æ|t instead of kʰæt. For this, you would set out_delimiter:  |  in your mapping. mappings: - language_name: English   display_name: English to IPA   in_lang: eng   out_lang: eng-ipa   type: mapping  authors:   - Aidan Pine  mapping: eng_to_ipa. json   out_delimiter:  |   # &lt;------- Add your delimiter herereverse (default: False)Setting this to reverse will try to reverse the mappings so that all characters defined as out in your mapping become the input characters and vice versa. Except for a few cases, this is unlikely to work very well for advanced mapings. mappings: - language_name: English   display_name: English to IPA   in_lang: eng   out_lang: eng-ipa   type: mapping  authors:   - Aidan Pine  mapping: eng_to_ipa. json   reverse: true  # &lt;------- Add thisprevent_feeding (default: False)Let’s say you have the following rules:       in   out         kw   kʷ       k   kʲ   Ordered in the way they are defined, an input of kw will produce kʲʷ and ordered the other way, an input of kw will produce kʲw. Neither of these are correct though! For this mapping, we want kʷ as the output. So, how do we solve this? There is a setting called prevent_feeding which, if set to true, will prevent the output of one rule from being processed by any subsequent rule. As described in rule order this process when one rule provides the context for another rule to apply is called ‘feeding’ and so this setting will prevent that from happening. Note, setting prevent_feeding: true for your whole mapping will do this for every rule. If you just want to prevent feeding for one particular rule, you can write your rules in JSON and add the key to the specific rule you want to prevent feeding for. [  {    in :  kw ,    out :  kʷ ,    prevent_feeding : true  },  {    in :  k ,    out :  kʲ   }]mappings: - language_name: English   display_name: English to IPA   in_lang: eng   out_lang: eng-ipa   type: mapping  authors:   - Aidan Pine  mapping: eng_to_ipa. json   prevent_feeding: true  # &lt;------- Add thisAdvanced: A deeper dive into writing tricky rules: You may have noticed that the rules described above for converting words like ‘dog’ and ‘cat’ to IPA are woefully incomplete. The real world use cases for g2p often need to account for a lot more messiness than was described in the artificial example above. In fact, for languages like English, g2p is likely not a good solution. The English writing system is notoriously inconsistent, and there already exist a variety of other tools that account for all of the lexical (word-specific) idiosyncracies in deriving the IPA-form from the orthographic form. For many Indigenous languages, the writing system is sufficiently close to the spoken form that g2p is a very appropriate solution. In the following sections, I’ll describe some common problems when writing rules, and how to fix them. Unicode Escape Sequences: Sometimes you need rules to convert from characters that either don’t render very well, or render in a confusing way. In those cases, you can alternatively use Unicode escape sequences. For example, maybe you want to write a rule that converts the standard ASCII ‘g’ to the strict IPA Unicode /ɡ/. As you can likely see on your browser, these characters look very similar, but they’re not! The ASCII ‘g’ is U+0067 and the strict IPA ‘ɡ’ is U+0261. So, you can write a rule as follows:       in   out         \u0067   \u0261   or using JSON: [  {     in :  \u0067 ,     out :  \u0261   }]This is also helpful when you need to write rules between combining characters or other confusable characters. The rule of thumb is, if your rules are clearer using Unicode escape sequences, do it! Otherwise, just use the normal character in place. Rule Ordering: The order of your rules in g2p really matters! This is because some rules can either create or remove the context for other rules to apply. In linguistics, these rule ordering patterns are usually talked about as either feeding, bleeding, counter-feeding, or counter-bleeding relationships. There are potentially valid reasons to want to encode any of these types of relationships in your rules. To illustrate a possible problem, let’s consider a g2p mapping for language that converts ‘a̱’ to ‘ə’ and ‘a’ to ‘æ’. ‘a̱’ is a sequence of a normal a followed by a combining macron below (\u0331). Because \u0331 (‘a̱’) is easily confusable with \u0332 (‘a̲’), in order to follow the rule of thumb for Unicode escape sequences, I’ll write the rules as follows:       in   out         a   æ       a\u0331   ə   Now, assuming an input to this mapping of ‘a̱’ (a\u0331), we would get ‘æ̱’ (æ\u0331) instead of ‘ə’. Why is that? Because the first rule applies and turns ‘a’ into ‘æ’ before the second rule has a chance to apply. This is called a ‘bleeding’ relationship. In order to avoid it, we would need to write our rules as follows:       in   out         a\u0331   ə       a   æ   With this ordering, our input of ‘a̱’ (a\u0331) would turn into ‘ə’ as we expect, and our input of ‘a’ would turn into æ also as expected. Try it out on the G2P Studio if you don’t believe me! Defining sets of characters: Some rules are written with repeating sets of characters that can be tedious to write out. For this, we might want to define certain sets of characters using a variable name. These can be written using special types of mapping files in g2p. For example, consider a series of rules which contextually apply only between vowels. Let’s say as an example of one of those rules, that dd turns to ð when it exists between two vowels. This language has the following vowels in its inventory: a,e,i,o,u,æ,å,ø. You could write the rules like this5:       in   out   context_before   context_after         dd   ð   (a|e|i|o|u|æ|å|ø)   (a|e|i|o|u|æ|å|ø)   But, if there are lots of rules with these vowels, this could get very tedious, not to mention annoying if the characters in the set change at some point. It is also less readable, and leaves the reader of the mapping to infer the meaning of the rule. So, in a separate file, by convention it is usually called abbreviations. csv, you can define a list of sets where each row is a new set. The first column contains the name of the set (by convention this is capitalized), and you can add characters to every following column. So, for example:       variable name                                                                     VOWEL   a   e   i   o   u   æ   å   ø                                   CONSONANT   p   b   t   d   k   g   f   s   h   v   j   r   l   m   n       FRONT   i   e   œ   ø   y                                               BACK   u   o   a                                                   Then, in your configuration, you can add the file to a specific mapping using abbreviations: abbreviations. csv. After adding it to your mapping, you can write the above rule like this instead:       in   out   context_before   context_after         dd   ð   VOWEL   VOWEL   You can also use abbreviations like this in the G2P studio by writing them in the section at the bottom of the page titled ‘Custom Abbreviations’ They will be automatically applied to your custom rules above.  Regular Expressions: Regular expressions are used ubiquitously in programming to do define certain search patterns in text. In fact, this is how g2p rules work! They eventually get compiled into a regular expression too. For the most part, you can add basic regular expressions to your rules Using specific indices: …more to come… Applications: There are number of different software tools that are already making use of g2p. For general purpose use in Python, have a look at this section.
